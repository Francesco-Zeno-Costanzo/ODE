# ODE
These codes are examples of solving ordinary differential equations using the finite difference method, the method of runge kutta of order 4, scipy's "odeint" function and some examples of symplectic integrator.
There is also an animation for the particle in the electromagnetic field for the Lorenz attractor and for the tunnel effect through a barrier.
The "ne≈çn katalogos" file (as the name might suggest) is a list containing several examples of implicit, explicit and symplectic ode-solving algorithms; all of them, for simplicity, applied to the harmonic oscillator.
