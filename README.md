# ODE
These codes are examples of solving ordinary differential equations using the finite difference method, the method of runge kutta of order 4 and scipy's "odeint" function.
There is also an animation for the particle in the electromagnetic field for the Lorenz attractor and for the tunnel effect through a barrier.
