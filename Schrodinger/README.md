In these codes the finite difference method and the shooting method is used to solve the Schrodinger equation for some potentials.
For the first method the precision is of O (h^2) and since h = L / n with n number of points, the states with high energy being spatially more extended require a greater L and consequently a greater n to keep h small. For the shooting method you can choose the tolerance on the search for the eigenvalue; on psi the error is that of odeint
There is also an animation for the tunnel effect with the repulsive barrier potential (ACHTUG there is no time dependence in animation).
